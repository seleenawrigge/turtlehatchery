        <p>
            Six out of the seven recognized sea turtle species, including all five found in Sri Lanka, are endangered. Sea Turtles face significant threats and are in urgent need of conservation efforts to prevent their extinction.

      <h1>Threats and Prevention</h1> <div class="line"></div>
      
      <p>Sea turtles face numerous threats that endanger their survival, including habitat loss, pollution, climate change, poaching, and accidental capture in fishing gear. By addressing these threats through proactive prevention measures, we can help protect and ensure the long-term survival of sea turtle populations.

          <p> The destruction of nesting beaches, coral reefs, and feeding grounds due to coastal development and human activities threaten sea turtles. Prevention: Implementing coastal management strategies, establishing protected areas, and promoting responsible tourism practices can help preserve their habitats.

          <p>Coral reefs are among the most valuable habitats for sea turtles. These vibrant ecosystems provide food sources, shelter, and nesting grounds for several sea turtle species. However, coral reefs worldwide face severe challenges due to coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and destructive fishing practices. Conservation organizations are actively working to protect and restore coral reefs by implementing sustainable fishing practices, reducing pollution and sedimentation, and promoting coral restoration initiatives. By preserving and rehabilitating coral reefs, we create a resilient environment that supports the survival of sea turtles and a multitude of marine species that depend on these invaluable ecosystems.

      <p>Rising temperatures, sea level rise, and ocean acidification disrupt sea turtle nesting sites and affect their food sources. Prevention: Mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting renewable energy, and supporting climate resilience measures can help protect sea turtles from the adverse effects of a changing climate.</p>

      <h5>If conservation efforts arent made to help sea turtles now it may mean a devasting future for these beautiful creatures. One of the main ways to tackle this issue is through hatcheries. Through incubation, providing protection, and raising public awareness, major changes can be made to help sea turtles bounce back from this critical stage.
